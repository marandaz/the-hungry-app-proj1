The Hungry App aims to solve one of life's hardest questions -- "what's for dinner?" while simultaneously being conscious about food waste.  A user can do a quick scan of what's already in their pantry and use those ingredients to search recipes that match. 
<br>
Who could also use a good laugh to make for some light-hearted conversation while cooking?! The Hungry App not only brings you inspiration for dinner, but also serves you with a joke. When the user searches, the first thing that shows is the set up, or the first part of the joke. I.e.. _"What's the best thing about elevator jokes?"_  Once they've saved a recipe as a favorite, they'll get the answer  --> _"They work on so many levels."_  The favorites page allows the user to revisit recipes later if they were a hit, or if the recipe looked good but perhaps not right at the time of search.
